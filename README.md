# Pointers in One Dimensional Arrays: Understanding Pointers in C with Arrays

**Author:** [Gabriel Tanase]  
**Date:** [06.12.2024]

## Overview

This web application demonstrates how pointers work with arrays in C. It visualizes the concepts of pointer operations, including assignment, dereferencing and incrementing/ decrementing.
Genereates a simple example involving an array of random numbers.
Users can interact with the pointer and observe how the pointer's position changes as they increment or decrement it.

## Instructions

1. Click **"Generate Random Array"** to generate a random array of numbers.
2. The **pointer** (initially at the beginning of the array) is highlighted in **yellow** in the array, and **purple** \*in the memory block.
3. Use the **Increment** and **Decrement** buttons to move the pointer through the array.
4. The **table** below the array shows examples of pointer operations, and the corresponding values and memory addresses are updated as you interact with the pointer.
